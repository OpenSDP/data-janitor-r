## OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (R)
## Nearly Unique

This example tutorial teaches how to implement decision rules in R when cleaning
longitudinal data. You will start with a sample data file that is nearly unique
at the student and school year level, and clean each variable until the data is
internally consistent.

This tutorial is in the form of an R Markdown Notebook, and to run it you will
need RStudio version 1.0 or higher. Download, unzip, and extract the files. Open
the .Rmd file within RStudio and click the "Preview Notebook" button. Or, step
through the code on your own by running each section of code and checking the
results.

This tutorial was originally authored by the Strategic Data Project.
